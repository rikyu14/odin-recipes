    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt, divided</li>
        <li>¾ cup boiling water</li>
        <li>½ cup cold water, or as needed</li>
        <li>vegetable oil, or as needed, divided</li>
        <li>1 bunch green onions (scallions), minced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix flour and 1 teaspoon salt together in a large bowl; pour in boiling water and quickly mix together until water is absorbed. Work cold water, about 1 tablespoon at a time, into flour mixture just until dough forms. Knead dough for 10 minutes. Cover bowl with a damp cloth and let dough rest for 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn dough onto a lightly floured work surface; divide into 4 equal pieces.</li>
        <li>Roll 1 piece of dough into a large thin round; brush the top with vegetable oil and sprinkle with about 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 the green onions. Pick up 1 end of the round and roll dough around green onions into a long scroll-shape. Take 1 scroll end and roll dough into a disk. Repeat with remaining dough, letting each disk rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat about 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Place 1 disk on a floured surface and roll into a 1/2-inch thick round; cook in the hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining disks.</li>
    </ol>
