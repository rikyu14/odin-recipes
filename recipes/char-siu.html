    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (1 pound) pork tenderloins</li>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>⅓ cup honey</li>
        <li>⅓ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>⅓ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup Chinese rice wine</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons red bean curd (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Stir soy sauce, honey, ketchup, brown sugar, rice wine, hoisin sauce, red bean curd, and five-spice powder together in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until just combined and slightly warm, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, slice each pork tenderloin lengthwise into 1 ½- to 2-inch-thick strips. Place pork strips in a large, resealable plastic bag.</li>
        <li>Pour marinade into the bag with the pork. Squeeze air from the bag, seal, and turn the bag a few times until pork is well coated. Marinate in the refrigerator, 2 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat a charcoal grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove pork from marinade and shake to remove excess liquid. Set aside the remaining marinade for basting.</li>
        <li>Rake the hot coals into two equal piles on opposite sides of the charcoal grate. Add a small container of water to the grate. Place pork strips in the center of the grate for indirect cooking.</li>
        <li>Cook pork over indirect heat, turning regularly and basting as desired, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 30 minutes or longer.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
